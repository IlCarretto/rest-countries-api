<p>I really enjoyed this one project! One of the most complex I've worked on, especially the custom useContext (useCountry) hook I built to manage the API calls. Maybe one thing I'm not really satisfied about is the CountryDetails page: there are some problems with responsiveness, and I couldn't get the logic to get the countries' name of the borders. Also added pagination for fun :)</p>
